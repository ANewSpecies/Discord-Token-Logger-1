# java-discord-token-logger
steals discord tokens, captures webcam, screenshots desktop, and pulls ip

also undetectable by anti virus since because of the nature of it

pretty cool token logger made in native java no extra libs needed the file encoding through webhooks were a pain in the ass lol

not responsible for whatever u do

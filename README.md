# java-discord-token-logger
Extracts discord tokens, captures webcam and desktop, and can log network information.

This project shouldn't be used for any criminal or juvenile purposes, this is only for educational purposes and wanted to try making a logger in java.

also i'll probably add browser passwords, cookies, and history logging as long with other cool things when i have time

I'm not responsible for whatever you do as I said this is only for educational purposes and to see how we can protect ourselves better
